# platform-20260928 -- ledger (newest first; `git add -f` this dir)

Goal (owner, 2026-09-28): continue building atx-engine + atx-impl into a production-quality equity L/S quant platform
(high Sharpe, high capacity, low turnover, low/medium frequency). Three fronts: (1) platform + pipeline for faster research
iteration, (2) the implementation and the mega strategy, (3) the pitch to production. Start with code review + web research
-> plan -> 3-4 Opus 5.5 implementer lanes. Root (pool-2) = PM: builds, real-data runs, acceptance, ledger.

Standing rules carried from mega-alpha-20260926 (unchanged): root alone builds (mega-build.ps1) and runs real data
(run_bounded_research.py 180 s / 1536 MiB); children own pool worktrees, never build, never run real data, never spawn

2020-2022 only; 2023-2024 used twice (new read = validation trial #3, owner gate U1); 2025+ reserved; never read a
per-candidate VAL statistic; no pushes, warehouse writes, broker actions; tree clean before every real-data run; every
ruling declared before any measurement it could bias; Appendix A trial accounting on every TRAIN result.

## 2026-09-28 sprint open
- Ruling: research phase first (P1 code review of platform/pipeline/production gaps, P2 literature on combination,
  construction with costs, risk models, capacity, platform design, new families) -> synthesis plan -> 3-4 implementer lanes
  -- owner asked for review + research before implementation -- cost if wrong: ~1 h of agent time before code moves.
- Ruling: research agents read-only, write to this dir; no measurements in this phase -- nothing to bias.
