"""Idempotent, resumable, deterministic full-warehouse activation.

The ladder runs one stage at a time in dependency order, records every attempt in
``activation_stage_runs``, and skips a stage whose newest attempt completed unless
``force`` is set. Every stage is a pure ``(store, options) -> StageResult``; the
ladder owns all ledgering, ordering, and reporting so a stage function stays
testable on its own.
